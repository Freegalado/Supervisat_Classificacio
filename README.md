# Supervisat_Classificacio

Description

Let's practice and become familiar with classification algorithms.

**Level 1**

- Exercises 1
Create at least three different classification models to try to best predict DelayedFlights.csv flight delay (ArrDelay). Consider whether the flight is late or not (ArrDelay> 0).

- Exercises 2
Compare classification models using accuracy, a confidence matrix, and other more advanced metrics.

- Exercises 3
Train them using the different parameters they support.

- Exercises 4
Compare your performance using the traint / test or cross-validation approach.

To continue later...

**Level 2**
- Exercises 5
Perform some variable engineering process to improve prediction


**Level 3**
- Exercises 6
Do not use the DepDelay variable when making predictions
